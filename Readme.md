## Feature Highlights

- Flake-based multi-host, multi-user NixOS and Home-Manager configurations
  - Core configs for hosts and users
  - Modular, optional configs for user and host-specific needs
- Secrets management via sops-nix and a _private_ nix-secrets repo which is included as a flake input
- Semi automated remote-bootstrapping of NixOS, nix-config
- Configuration features:
  - Disko for delclarative 
  - Impermanence, root on tmpfs
  - Sops makes it so I don't need to store encrypted or hashed user passwords in a public repo
  - Neovim, via nixvim, with treesitter, lsp and completion, etc
  - nix-index-database, and Comma (Run programs without installing using executable name not package name)
  - Stylix applies Catppuccin Mocha everywhere* (most places)
  - greetd as the display manager, with regreet for the authentication UI
  - custom packages
  - Activation Scripts:
    - Git commit (not push) after every successful rebuild switch (not during boot) with a useful comment
    - ensure directories in users home is present
  - Everything I did using ansible on my previous Arch install (Bluetooth, Avahi etc)
  - Laptop support using tlp, thermald and more
  - Steam with gamescope, proton-ge, remote play, font fixes, etc

## Packages

Not all packages in the pkgs directory are usable. Some may be unfinished, experiments or I forgot to delete them, some may be dependencies for packages that are not ready. Some may be internal tools not directly usable in other environments.

Here are the packages that should be usable:

- `bitwarden-rofi`
  - *github.com:mattydebie/bitwarden-rofi*
  - Use bitwarden through rofi or similar menu systems
- `bose-connect-app-linux`
  -  *github.com:airvzxf/bose-connect-app-linux*
  - Unofficial bose connect alternative for Linux
- `TwilightBoxart`
  -  *github.com:MateusRodCosta/TwilightBoxart*
  - A coverart downloader for TwilightMenu++ and some other frontends
- `tidal-dl-ng`
  - *github.com/exislow/tidal-dl-ng*
  - Multithreaded TIDAL Media Downloader Next Generation! Up to HiRes Lossless / TIDAL MAX 24-bit, 192 kHz and Dolby Atmos.
  - helper package `tidal-dl-ng-gui` dont install this, its just for running the gui directly from nix run

Running the applications without installing should be as easy as 

```nix
nix run "github:sigboe/nixos-config#bose-connect-app-linux" -- --help
```

TwilightBoxart requires a few more options, because the program doesn't have a license, it is technically unfree software. The environment variable needs to be set for nix run, even if you have enabled unfree packages in your config. And for nix run to respect environment variables you need the --impure flag

```nix
NIXPKGS_ALLOW_UNFREE=1 nix run --impure "github:sigboe/nixos-config#TwilightBoxart" 
```

To install the packages, you can either ingegrate them in tour nix config, or add my repo as an input, and use whatever method you want to install packages from outside nixpkgs (example overlays or referencing the package directly) For TwilightBoxart specifically, you also either need to enable unfree packages in your config, or add an exception for TwilightBoxart

## TODO

- ~~Fix overlays~~
- ~~Look into bootstrapping without sops workaround~~Â (untested solution in place)

## Hosts

Not all hosts are yet migrated to NixOS, but names are reserved. 
Names are based on pre-colonial Filipino mythology ðŸ‡µðŸ‡­

| **Machine**  | **Name** |
|--------------|----------|
| XPS 13       | Tala     |
| Gaming PC    | Lalahon  |
| HP EliteDesk | Kaptan   |
| Home Server  | Bathala  |
| Rapsberry Pi | wakwak   |
|              |          |
| HP EliteBook | Amihan   |
| Gaming PC    | Haliya   |

## Secrets Managment

## Initial Install Notes

Currently there is an issue with using sops during provisioning. A computer with nix or nixos is required currently. These are basic instructions for my self, if you copy this whole setup you need to do more changes. More detailed, but in progress instructions [here](docs/Install.md)

- Pull down the repo, and change the user password temporarily
- Pull down secrets repo to get luks key
- have ssh keys available for the secrets repo
- use nixos anywhere to provision locally changed flake (magic incantation will be in the full install notes)
- after install, pull down flake repo, put in /etc/nixos 
- transfer ssh priv keys, pull down secrets repo, add new age keys to secrets repo
- update /etc/nixos to fetch the newest version of secrets repo
- rebuild switch
